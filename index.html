But after his very first travel back in time, Eobard learned that he was destined to become the Flash's archenemy and grew to despise the hero, attempting to prove his superiority as the Reverse-Flash and therefore became the opposite of the Flash. Since then, the two speedsters battled one another for many years, but neither of them were strong or fast enough to defeat each other.</p>

                            <p>Jay Garrick is a veteran speedster from Earth Three and the vigilante known as The Flash. Jay was found by Hunter Zolomon, a meta-human speedster from Earth Two, and held prisoner forced to wear an iron mask that dampened his powers. His name and mantle as the Flash was taken by Hunter to carry out facades as part of a plan to inspire false hope in Central City. After being rescued by Team Flash, Jay found his way back to Earth Three with the help of Harry and Jesse. Despite Hunter's deception, Jay took his helmet so he can make the symbol of hope his own. Jay Garrick would work with Barry Allen, the Flash of Earth One, in his fight against the speedster known as Savitar. </p>

                            <p>Wallace "Wally" West (born 1995) is the son of Joe and the late Francine West, and the younger brother of Iris West. He was a champion drag-racer under the alias "Taillights". In the alternate "Flashpoint" timeline, Wally West was the meta-human speedster known prominently as The Flash. As the protector of Central City, he fought against his archenemy Edward Clariss/The Rival. He later regained his speed in the post-Flashpoint timeline, donning the name Kid Flash, which is also how he was nicknamed by his friends and some members of the media in the Flashpoint timeline. After defeating and detaining the criminal known as Plunder, he was embraced by Central City and officially became known as Kid Flash to all. </p>

                            <p>Edward Clariss was a meta-human speedster, during both the "Flashpoint" timeline and the current timeline. Known to the public as the Rival, he acted as the archenemy of Wally West/The Flash in the Flashpoint timeline and was ultimately defeated thanks to the joint efforts of Barry Allen, Wally West and Joe West, guided by the other members of Team Flash. In the current timeline, Clariss, having flashbacks to the Flashpoint timeline, met with Alchemy, who gave him the same powerset and costume he wore in that timeline, sending him to kill Barry. However, he was defeated by Barry and Cisco Ramon and incarcerated in Iron Heights Prison, where Alchemy condemned him for his failure and Savitar killed him.</p>
